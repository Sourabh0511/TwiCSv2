# TwiCSv2
TwiCS is a system which is a implementation of ideas discussed in research paper called "TwiCS: Microblog Entity Mention Detection with Multi-pass Lightweight Computations"
## 1.Usage of the code
This repository contains source code for both experiments that represented in the paper and production code that can be applied for different settings.

### 1.1 Production Code
Production code is great way to navigate the system. Simply run the simulator which is called simulation_cross_validation with your python 3 interpreter.
```
python3 simulation_cross_validation.py
```
### 1.2 Experiments
Experiments are way to assess our performance and effectiveness in order to compare to other systems.
